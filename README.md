## Apple 2 Dynamic Memory

This is an implementation of a dynamic memory allocator for the Apple 2 written
in 6502 Assembly for [Merlin32](http://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/merlin/).

See demo.s for an example.

## Credits

The algorithm is taken from Donald Knuth's first-fit memory allocator in The Art of Computer Programming Vol. 1.
